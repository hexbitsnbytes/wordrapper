1. Download the zip file containing the script (click on the green "Code" button to the right of the screen)
2. Open terminal in the current OS X Finder Location [Link: How to geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/210147/how-to-open-terminal-in-the-current-os-x-finder-location/)
3. ESSENTIAL: Before running the script for the first time, you need to run: `chmod +x wordrapper.bash`. This is only required once. It will give the file the proper permissions to be executed. 
4. Run `./wordrapper.bash <name of the file to process>` 
    **Note**: do not include the `<` or `>` character in the command
5. The file to process should be in the same directory as where the `wordrapper.bash` file is
    Feel free to move it around.
