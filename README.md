### Wordrapper Usage

1. Download the zip file containing the script (click on the green "Code" button to the right of the screen)
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the text sample to process
3. Before running the script for the first time, you need to run: `chmod +x wordrapper.bash`. This is only required once. It will give the file the proper permissions to be executed. 
3. Run `./wordrapper.bash <name of the file to process>` Note: do not include the lesser/greater than characters in the command
4. The file to process should be in the same directory as where the wordrapper.bash file is
